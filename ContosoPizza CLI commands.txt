Build and start the web API by running the following command:
	dotnet run

If you opened a new terminal, connect to our web API by running the following command:
	httprepl https://localhost:{PORT}

Alternatively, run the following command at any time while the HttpRepl is running:
	(Disconnected)> connect https://localhost:{PORT}

Navigate to the Pizza endpoint by running the following command:
	cd Pizza

Run the following command to see the new actions on the Pizza API:
	ls

The preceding command will output available APIs available for the Pizza endpoint:
	https://localhost:{PORT}/Pizza> ls
	.      [GET|POST]
	..     []
	{id}   [GET|PUT|DELETE]

Make a POST request to add a new pizza in the HttpRepl by using the following command:
	post -c "{"name":"Hawaii", "isGlutenFree":false}"

The following command will make a POST request to add the new pizza to our inventory and then will return a list of all pizza back:
	HTTP/1.1 201 Created
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:23:09 GMT
	Location: https://localhost:{PORT}/Pizza?id=3
	Server: Kestrel
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked

	{
		"id": 3,
		"name": "Hawaii",
		"isGlutenFree": false
	}
	
Let's update the new Hawaii pizza to a Hawaiian pizza with a PUT request with the following command:
	put 3 -c  "{"id": 3, "name":"Hawaiian", "isGlutenFree":false}"
	
This will return the following output that it was successful:
	HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
	Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:23:55 GMT
	Server: Kestrel

To verify that the pizza was updated, we can rerun the GET action with the following command:
	get 3
	
This will return the newly updated pizza:
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:27:37 GMT
	Server: Kestrel
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked

	{
		"id": 3,
		"name": "Hawaiian",
		"isGlutenFree": false
	}

Our API can also delete the newly created pizza with the DELETE action by running the following command:
	delete 3

This will return a 204 No Content for success:
	HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
	Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:30:04 GMT
	Server: Kestrel
	
To verify that the pizza was removed, we can rerun the GET action with the following command:
	get

This will return our original pizzas as results:
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:31:15 GMT
	Server: Kestrel
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked
